### Welcome

I'm Alisa Chupakhina, a QA/Python developer interested in ML. I am initiative, I love it when the world is logical and I want to do what I really love - to make life easier for people and to improve the world. I love the word “impossible” and I know how to make the impossible happen.

Now I participate not only in autotesting, but also in a project with machine learning and I am interested in both of these areas.
