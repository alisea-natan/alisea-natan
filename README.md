### Welcome

I'm Alisa Chupakhina, a Junior Test Engineer interested in learning automated testing in Python.
I want to learn it because I like to make the world more logical and orderly.
And also because I enjoy solving logical problems.

Now I participate not only in autotesting, but also in a project with machine learning and I am interested in both of these areas.
