### Greetings
You looked into `Alisa Chupakhina's` account. 

I'm a Junior Test Engineer interested in learning automated testing in Python.
I want to learn it because I like to make the world more logical and orderly.
And also because solving logical problems is kind of pleasure for me.

Now I take part not only in autotesting, but also in a project with machine learning and I am interested in both of these areas of development.
